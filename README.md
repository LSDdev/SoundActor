# About SoundActor

Something about the package

# Installing Core

Add this into your project's package manifest 

```` json
"fi.uniarts.soundactor": "https://github.com/LSDdev/SoundActor.git"
````

You also need to setup the FMOD Unity integration with Unity's assemblt definitoins in order this to work. After you have installed FMOD's Unity packe, go to your assets and locate the FMOD plugin and locate the Runtime folder under src. Create asmdef with a name of **FMODUnity** under Runtime and add Timeline as dependancy.
